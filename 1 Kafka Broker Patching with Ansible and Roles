 Installing Java, Maven, and Git Using Ansible Roles
Directory Structure:
The typical structure for organizing Ansible roles is as follows:

css
Copy code
├── ansible.cfg
├── inventory
├── playbook.yml
└── roles
    ├── java
    │   └── tasks
    │       └── main.yml
    ├── maven
    │   └── tasks
    │       └── main.yml
    └── git
        └── tasks
            └── main.yml
ansible.cfg: Ansible configuration file.
inventory: Contains the IPs or hostnames of the servers where Ansible will run.
playbook.yml: The main playbook that runs the roles.
roles/: Contains directories for each role (Java, Maven, Git), and within each role, there are tasks that define the actions to be executed.
Step 1: Define the ansible.cfg (Optional)
You can configure Ansible to pick up your inventory file and other settings by default:

ini
Copy code
[defaults]
inventory = ./inventory
remote_user = ubuntu
private_key_file = ~/.ssh/id_rsa
host_key_checking = False
Step 2: Define the inventory file
List your target servers (in this case, assume an IP address of the server):

ini
Copy code
[web_servers]
192.168.33.10
Step 3: Create the Roles
1. Java Role
Create a roles/java/tasks/main.yml file for installing Java:

yaml
Copy code
---
# roles/java/tasks/main.yml
- name: Ensure Java is installed
  apt:
    name: openjdk-11-jdk
    state: present
  become: yes
Explanation: This task uses the apt module to install the openjdk-11-jdk package (Java 11) on an Ubuntu-based server. The become: yes ensures the task is executed with sudo privileges.
2. Maven Role
Create a roles/maven/tasks/main.yml file for installing Maven:

yaml
Copy code
---
# roles/maven/tasks/main.yml
- name: Ensure Maven is installed
  apt:
    name: maven
    state: present
  become: yes
Explanation: This task installs Maven using the apt package manager.
3. Git Role
Create a roles/git/tasks/main.yml file for installing Git:

yaml
Copy code
---
# roles/git/tasks/main.yml
- name: Ensure Git is installed
  apt:
    name: git
    state: present
  become: yes
Explanation: This task installs Git using the apt package manager.
Step 4: Create the Playbook
Create the playbook.yml file that invokes the roles:

yaml
Copy code
---
# playbook.yml
- hosts: web_servers
  become: yes
  roles:
    - java
    - maven
    - git
Explanation: This playbook targets the web_servers group (defined in the inventory file) and runs the java, maven, and git roles on them. The become: yes ensures all tasks in the playbook are executed with elevated privileges.
Step 5: Run the Playbook
To execute the playbook and install Java, Maven, and Git on the target server, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
Summary of the Workflow:
The inventory file defines which servers the playbook will target (e.g., a server with IP 192.168.33.10).
The playbook invokes the roles in sequence: java, maven, and git.
Each role contains specific tasks for installing the required software using the apt package manager:
Java is installed via openjdk-11-jdk.
Maven is installed via the maven package.
Git is installed via the git package.
This modular approach is easy to extend or modify. For example, you could add more roles to the playbook or update a specific role to install a different version of the software.

Benefits of Using Roles:
Modular and Reusable: Roles break down tasks into reusable components, making it easier to manage and maintain large playbooks.
Separation of Concerns: Each role has a single responsibility, which makes your configuration clear and manageable.
Scalability: You can reuse the same roles across different environments or servers.
Flexibility: Adding, removing, or updating a role is simple and does not affect the rest of the playbook.
This setup allows you to quickly install and configure multiple packages on your servers in a structured and maintainable way.

A good use case for Kafka broker patching using Ansible with roles is the scenario where you need to automate the update or patching of Kafka brokers across multiple nodes in a Kafka cluster. Regular patching is crucial for ensuring security, performance, and bug fixes in Kafka environments. By using Ansible, you can automate this process, ensuring minimal downtime and consistent configuration across the cluster.

Use Case: Kafka Broker Patching with Ansible and Roles
Objective:
Patch Kafka brokers across a cluster of servers by performing the following steps:
Stop the Kafka broker service.
Update or patch the Kafka installation.
Start the Kafka broker service.
Ensure the Kafka broker is running correctly after the patch.
Steps:
Ansible Inventory: Defines the Kafka broker nodes in your cluster.
Ansible Roles: Roles handle tasks such as stopping Kafka, patching Kafka, and starting Kafka, ensuring a modular and reusable approach.
Example Directory Structure:
The Ansible project will have the following structure:

css
Copy code
.
├── ansible.cfg
├── inventory
├── playbook.yml
└── roles
    ├── kafka_patch
    │   ├── tasks
    │   │   ├── main.yml
    │   │   ├── stop_kafka.yml
    │   │   ├── patch_kafka.yml
    │   │   └── start_kafka.yml
    │   └── handlers
    │       └── main.yml
    └── common
        └── tasks
            └── install_java.yml
1. Define ansible.cfg (Optional)
ini
Copy code
[defaults]
inventory = ./inventory
remote_user = ubuntu
private_key_file = ~/.ssh/id_rsa
host_key_checking = False
2. Define the inventory file
The inventory file contains the list of Kafka broker nodes:

ini
Copy code
[kafka_brokers]
broker1 ansible_host=192.168.1.10
broker2 ansible_host=192.168.1.11
broker3 ansible_host=192.168.1.12
3. Create the kafka_patch Role
The Kafka patching process will be split into multiple tasks, and each task will be modular, like stopping Kafka, applying the patch, and restarting Kafka.

a) Main Task File: roles/kafka_patch/tasks/main.yml
The main task file calls specific task files for stopping, patching, and restarting Kafka.

yaml
Copy code
---
# roles/kafka_patch/tasks/main.yml
- include_tasks: stop_kafka.yml
- include_tasks: patch_kafka.yml
- include_tasks: start_kafka.yml
b) Stop Kafka Broker Task: roles/kafka_patch/tasks/stop_kafka.yml
This task stops the Kafka broker on the target machine:

yaml
Copy code
---
# roles/kafka_patch/tasks/stop_kafka.yml
- name: Stop Kafka broker service
  service:
    name: kafka
    state: stopped
  become: yes
  notify: "Check Kafka status"
Explanation: Uses the service module to stop the Kafka service. It also includes a notification to trigger the handler that checks Kafka status after restarting.
c) Patch Kafka Task: roles/kafka_patch/tasks/patch_kafka.yml
This task handles the patching or updating of Kafka:

yaml
Copy code
---
# roles/kafka_patch/tasks/patch_kafka.yml
- name: Download the latest Kafka package
  get_url:
    url: https://archive.apache.org/dist/kafka/latest/kafka_2.13-2.8.0.tgz
    dest: /tmp/kafka.tgz
  become: yes

- name: Extract the Kafka package
  unarchive:
    src: /tmp/kafka.tgz
    dest: /opt/kafka
    remote_src: yes
  become: yes

- name: Update Kafka binaries
  command: cp -r /opt/kafka/kafka_2.13-2.8.0/* /opt/kafka/
  become: yes
Explanation:
The get_url module downloads the latest Kafka package.
The unarchive module extracts the downloaded Kafka tarball.
Finally, the command module copies the new binaries to the Kafka installation directory.
d) Start Kafka Broker Task: roles/kafka_patch/tasks/start_kafka.yml
This task starts the Kafka broker after the patch is applied:

yaml
Copy code
---
# roles/kafka_patch/tasks/start_kafka.yml
- name: Start Kafka broker service
  service:
    name: kafka
    state: started
  become: yes
Explanation: Uses the service module to start the Kafka broker.
4. Create Handlers for Post-Patch Validation
a) Create Handler: roles/kafka_patch/handlers/main.yml
This handler will be used to validate the status of Kafka after the patch:

yaml
Copy code
---
# roles/kafka_patch/handlers/main.yml
- name: Check Kafka status
  command: systemctl status kafka
  become: yes
  register: kafka_status
  ignore_errors: yes

- name: Fail if Kafka is not running
  fail:
    msg: "Kafka service is not running"
  when: kafka_status.rc != 0
Explanation:
The first task checks if the Kafka service is running after the patch.
If the service is not running (rc != 0), it triggers a failure with an appropriate message.
5. Common Role: Install Java
Kafka requires Java, so we can use a common role to ensure Java is installed on the server.

Install Java Task: roles/common/tasks/install_java.yml
yaml
Copy code
---
# roles/common/tasks/install_java.yml
- name: Install OpenJDK 11
  apt:
    name: openjdk-11-jdk
    state: present
  become: yes
Explanation: This installs OpenJDK 11 using the apt module.
6. Create the Playbook
The main playbook, playbook.yml, ties together the common role and the Kafka patch role:

yaml
Copy code
---
# playbook.yml
- hosts: kafka_brokers
  become: yes
  roles:
    - common
    - kafka_patch
Explanation: The playbook first ensures Java is installed using the common role, and then it runs the kafka_patch role to patch the Kafka brokers.
7. Running the Playbook
To execute the playbook and patch Kafka brokers across your cluster, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
Summary of the Workflow:
Ansible Inventory defines the Kafka broker nodes.
Common Role ensures Java is installed before patching Kafka (if needed).
Kafka Patch Role stops the Kafka service, downloads the latest Kafka version, applies the patch, and restarts the service.
Handlers validate the Kafka service status after patching.
Modularity: Each task (stop, patch, start) is separated into specific task files, which makes the playbook easier to manage and reusable.
Key Benefits of Using Ansible for Kafka Patching:
Automation: Manual intervention is minimized, reducing the risk of human error.
Modular Design: The roles and tasks are reusable and can be adapted for different environments.
Consistency: All Kafka brokers are patched using the same process, ensuring consistent results across the cluster.
Zero Downtime: If needed, you can introduce rolling updates by updating brokers one by one, ensuring minimal downtime for Kafka clusters.
